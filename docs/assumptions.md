## About the reader

- During the whole project I'll assume you have a basic notion of basic NBA stats. For the advanced ones I'll provide additional context to make conclusions clearer.

## About data

- We are not counting on data game by game which might add an extra level of detail to our model and conclusions so the expected outcome is a summary of the ideal season base on 3 or 4 predictors and then getting an average per game.
- **There are differences in the number of matches per season across seasons which might affect the performance (this is an assumption that needs to be tested against data)**.

## About final model
- We are not only the perfect model but learning how to apply multiple linear regression. In the future, an extension of this project might 
use other algorithms to predict with more accuracy if needed.
