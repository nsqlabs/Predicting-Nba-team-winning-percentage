## Where are this type of analytics being used?

These features are used in datasets:

- [Per game stats dataset](../datasets/per-game.md)
- [Per 100 possessions stats dataset](../datasets/per-100-possesions.md)
- [Season total stats dataset](../datasets/season-totals.md)

## Assumptions

> In this project I assume you have a basic notion of how basketball is played and what each feature means. This is only for clarification regarding abbreviations. For advanced stats I'll provide additional context.

All this explanations are based on the preprocessed data. There are certain features that were added during preprocessing or raw data treatment.
