- [X] Create raw datasets.
- [X] Fix advanced stats dataset headers.
- [X] Remove league averages from datasets.
- [X] Create dataset that summarizes win, losses and the needed dataset.

> How much would this problem change by changing it from a regression problem to one of classify or does not classify to playoffs? That's all what matters at the end but I would need to see how much impact having shorter seasons have. Also I should consider the salaries or something like that? **Is this what everyone mean when they advice you to define a clear goal before starting any project?**
